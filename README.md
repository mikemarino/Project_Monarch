 ## DESCRIPTION
Our web app is to help Pet owners find relaible pet sitters in their area who they can use for diffrent services. which can range from dog sitting, dog walking, administer medication, feeding, grooming, etc

We designed an area where users can have services provided and can also sign up to become sitters. The sitters can write a brief discription, their skills, and the service they will provide along with the the set price for their services.

Currently service are provided to small domestic animals such as dogs, cats, birds, fish. We hope to expand service to other species and "larger" pets in the future. We also expect to expand to other cities and regions around the US. In the future we would like to certified users with trining such as emegency CRP and medication adminstration non-invasive and other
